# Application Development Using Microservices and Serverless

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a scalable and resilient application using microservices architecture and serverless computing. The application is designed to leverage the benefits of both paradigms to achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is divided into multiple loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Serverless Computing**: Utilizes serverless functions to handle specific tasks, reducing the need for server management and allowing for automatic scaling.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Event-Driven**: Uses event-driven architecture to enable asynchronous communication between services.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with various databases to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: [List of languages used, e.g., C#, JavaScript, Python]
- **Frameworks**: [List of frameworks used, e.g., .NET Core, Express.js]
- **Cloud Services**: [List of cloud services used, e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions]
- **Databases**: [List of databases used, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]
